- 👋 Hi, I’m @diyafury

I am a freelance front-end developer and I totally dabble in fullstack like most of us. 
I do mostly WordPress websites for a set of faitful clients but I have commercial experience in AngularJS and ReactJs web applications.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Moving away from commercial websites and would love to gain more experience in software development with ReactJs, NodeJs, Express.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

A bit of everything, I've recently moved from bitbucket to github and keen to do at least one commit a day, to 'greenify' my github profile. 
So watch this space as I will attempt to use my profile as a bit of a playground going forward.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

on React software development projects across devices. I have a lot to learn and I'm not lacking in enthusiasm. 
I'm easy-going and conscientious... work well in a team and also solo.
