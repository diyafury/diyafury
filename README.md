- 👋 Hi, I’m @diyafury

I am a freelance front-end developer and I totally dabble in fullstack like most of us. I am an expert in CSS/HTML5/Javascript and a myriad of frameworks/libraries in this regard. I have years of agency experience and have been a Team Lead in the past.

Currently I'm working in ReactJS and Wordpress mostly but I also have commercial experience in AngularJS and a myriad other front-end technologies, libraries and framework. 
The nature of my position is learning on the job. The last few months I have been largely working in React on a peice of CMS software ads well as smaller bespoke kiosk applications togeter with a team of developers.

Moving away from standard marketing websites and would love to gain more experience in software development with ReactJs, NodeJs, Express.

I am also really interested in coding art projects... interactive exhibitions, I have had a tiny taste of this and I want more. I would love to get involved in a bit of electronics/robotics.

A bit of everything but I am doing more real world project training with React at the moment. I have just completed my 200h yoga teacher training and will be continuing on to my 300h course.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

React software development projects and native mobile development. There's always lot to learn and I'm not lacking in enthusiasm. 
I'm easy-going and conscientious... work well in a team and also solo.

Interactive art projects... even being a fly-on-the-wall, cups-of-tea-maker, a-cable-or-a-socket-finder, general-dogs-body.... just let me be involved!
