- 👋 Hi, I’m @diyafury

I am a freelance front-end developer and I totally dabble in fullstack like most of us. I am an expert in CSS/HTML5/Javascript and a myriad of frameworks/libraries in this regard. I have years of agency experience and have been a Team Lead in the past.

Currently the universe and my set of faithful clients have me make peace with Wordpress mostly but I also have commercial experience in AngularJS and ReactJs web applications.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Moving away from standard marketing websites and would love to gain more experience in software development with ReactJs, NodeJs, Express.

I am also really interested in coding art projects... interactive exhibitions, I have had a tiny taste of this and I want more. I would love to get involved in a bit of electronics/robotics.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

A bit of everything but I would like to become more confident with React. I've recently moved from bitbucket to github and I'm aiming to do at least one commit a day, to 'greenify' my github profile and to visualise my learning journey. I have many saved code snippets and tutorials to try out, there is no time like the present to start emptying that bucket list.

I'm also learning a bit of Python as I volunteer at a school of digitial integration to entice 9 - 13 year olds into coding.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

React software development projects across devices. I have a lot to learn and I'm not lacking in enthusiasm. 
I'm easy-going and conscientious... work well in a team and also solo.

Interactive art projects... even being a fly-on-the-wall, cups-of-tea-maker, a-cable-or-a-socket-finder, general-dogs-body.... just let me be involved!

- 📫 How to reach me ...
